# 12DoFSim

This is a 12 DOF simulation that intends to use Euler, quaternion and poisson kinematical equations for computation of the Euler angles. A big focus is to eventually be able to use different aerodynamic, propulsion and aircraft/objects models for simulation as well as explore different numerical schemes for integration. Where feasible, the simulation results will be compared to publicly available NASA flight test data for verification of results and equations.
